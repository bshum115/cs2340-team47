If you've ever wondered, here's information about Chipoltle's...
Steak:
"Depending on the packaged meat. So I think 20 ish steaks per bag.

we prep 2 bags at once. but ill say the ingredients for one.

1 pack of Adobe (it's like a red marinate, spicy)
1/4 cup of salt
1/6 cup of honey
1/2 cup of soy oil
mix that up
spread the steak evenly in your prepping , dont overlap. do half the steak if you have too and add the rest.
mix it really good.

cook for a minute on each side

i think the grill is at 400 F but i dont know"


Chicken:
"We have a huge box of chicken and we use 2 adobos for it.
So for about 15-20 chicken thighs
1 pack of adobo
1/6 cup of honey
1/2 cup of oil

you salt it when it's being grilled

3-4 minutes each side, use your judgement"

Chips:
"Pretty much pre-cut tortilla chips.
Fry them at 375 F for like 24 seconds, best use your judgement not too dark. they should be a light gold
place them in a rice bowl, or something like that
squeeze half a lime, add salt, then flip them, like in one motion, it takes skill, you can shake it too
then lime the other side, salt."

Adobo:
"i think a package is 12-20 ounces (Liquid sauce)
im going to say 16"
they do but i never paid attention, I'll check at work tomorrow."
